  "complex-numbers-problem-1": "You are an engineer hired by AstroSatellites & Co. to study a 2-meter-high antenna that must rotate to always point at the same satellite. Among the various calculations you need to perform, you are naturally interested in knowing the final position of the antenna after a certain rotation. The first idea that comes to mind is to use the following rotation matrix:",
  "complex-numbers-problem-2": "This works, but if we are asked to add tilts or rotations around other axes, the task becomes much more complex. Therefore, we can find a much simpler and immediate solution: complex numbers allow us to identify how far a point is displaced along the X-axis (real part) and the Y-axis (imaginary part), as well as to know the length of a vector (ρ) and its rotation angle (θ). So, let's think of our antenna, viewed from above, as the complex number:",
  "complex-numbers-problem-3": "With this, we can now calculate all the known rotations, and we can consider the task successfully completed!"
